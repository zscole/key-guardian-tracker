##  Mission

Key Guardian helps secure the open-source ecosystem by:

1. **Detecting** exposed API keys in public repositories
2. **Alerting** developers via GitHub issues with responsible disclosure
3. **Fixing** problems by submitting PRs with secure alternatives
4. **Tracking** impact and helping developers learn

##  Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- Keys are pattern-matched, never stored or used
- Developers are notified privately via GitHub issues
- We provide actionable fixes, not just warnings
- We help, not shame

##  Impact

Every leaked key we find and help fix:
- Prevents potential financial damage (API abuse)
- Protects user data
- Educates developers on security best practices
